# GRPC Project Distributed Systems

This project is to create interprocess communication protocols between distributed systems. It is to create a password service between interconnected services. The project must be done using gRPC methods.

Passwords must be stored in a proper encoding method. This project is to hash and salt passwords so that they do not get broken by encryption methods as the salting generates a new form of the hashed password.

## Instructions

1. The user runs the program and must type their user ID with an Integer.

2. The user must input their password. 

3. The password will be automatically hashed and salted, and a new password is generated to prove that it has been encoded correctly.

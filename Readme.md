# GRPC Project Distributed Systems

This project is to create interprocess communication protocols between distributed systems. It is to create a password service between interconnected services. The project must be done using gRPC methods.

Passwords must be stored in a proper encoding method. This project is to hash and salt passwords so that they do not get broken by encryption methods as the salting generates a new form of the hashed password.
